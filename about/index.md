# About Me




My name is Dongxu, a Ph.D. student working at FSHD group, Human Genetics, LUMC. I am focusing on heterogeneity of FSHD at single cell level using multi-omics datasets. By now, I have been working on data analysis of single cell RNA-seq. I am interested in data analysis on different types of dataset and setting up pipelines. I am enjoying data visualization using R language as well. Apart from the dry lab work, more and more experiment skills are also on my list which I would like to learn in the near future.



This blog I set up aims to record everything I am learning during my Ph.D. period. It will not only include biostatistics, data analysis, R language, Python and part of my research which are more related to my career plan, but also involve something about my thinking on life and work etc. This is my own place to record my life so I can recall all of the things after a few years later.



I like hiking and traveling. The Ice Land is my favorite country I have ever been. I like walking close to the nature and appreciate the primitive nature. Hiking on the glacier and volcano impressed me a lot. I am also a big fan of Harry Potter. I read the first book since I was primary student. I can not forget the time I was reading the book while checking new words in a dictionary.



Now, I am addicted in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I have never kept the idea of saving the princess in my mind. Cooking and hanging out in the Hyrule Kingdom.



I am happy to communicate with everyone who read my posts and have any questions :)
